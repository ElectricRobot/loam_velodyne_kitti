# loam_velodyne_kitti
This package is a simple modified copy of [loam_velodyne git repository](https://github.com/laboshinl/loam_velodyne) from **laboshinl** to work with the KITTI dataset.
 
Main changes have been done in:
 
ScanRegistration.cpp
MultiScanRegistration.cpp
LaserOdometry.cpp
LaserMapping.cpp
TransformMaintenance.cpp

where there are functions that return transform matrices based on the Eigen library instead of ROS odometry topics.
 
Also, transformToEnd() and transformToStart() functions have been modified since the KITTI Dataset is distorsion free.

The separation of the Velodyne HDL-64's rings have been done according to laboshinl's code.

How to build:

```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ make
```
Running:
```
$ ./main "KITTI Dataset Path" "NumberOfSequence"
```

Important things to change:

Add time stamps to each function that returns a point cloud or transform. This should fix the results.
